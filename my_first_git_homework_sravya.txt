1.	Git Workflow Fundamentals:
•	Working directory: Working directory is a working area where I can unpack and edit, add the files before committing.
•	Staging area: Index or cache contains proposed next commit. This shows the changes in the files that are going to happen in the next commit.
•	Local Repo(head): Repository where working copy of project files associated, we can make initial changes like our remote computer.
•	Remote Repo(master): Common repository that all the team members use, a server contains code hosting service like Github. We can access the remote repository of whole project on internet.

2.	Working Directory States:
•	Staged: Step in git allows to make changes to working directory, allows to record changes in small commits.
•	Modified: The files that are edited since the last commit and are not committed and kept staged are shown to be modified. Once committed, the cycle repeats.
•	Committed: This means changes are saved to local repository. If push and commit, changes are saved to remote repository.

3.	 Git commands:
•	 Git add: Adds a change in the staging area of working directory for next commit.
•	Git Commit: Used to create snapshot of staged changes along projects timeline.
•	Git Push: Upload changes done in local repository to remote repository.
•	Git Fetch: Command used to download files from a local repository so that we can find all current changes and branches in the remote repository.
•	Git Merge: Used to integrate changes from the other branch. Merging takes changes from source branch and integrates to target branch.
•	Git Pull: Search and download content from remote repository and add to local repository.
